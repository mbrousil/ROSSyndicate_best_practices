# ROSSyndicate style guide

ROSSyndicate best practices repository. A one-stop shop for the lab's coding best practices to implement Radical Open Science.


## Overarching Philosphies

- All code and software are licensed with the MIT use license. While we believe that all code and software should be public, we acknowledge that other researchers may wish to keep any code derived from ours private due to institutional barriers including but not limited to racism, sexism, and homophobia.

- GitHub contributions follow the 'fork' methodology that is common in most open science repositories  (as opposed to the 'branch' method). 

- All GitHub contributions are reviewed before being incorporated into the lab organization repository, except upon initial repository set up.

- We follow [the {tidyverse} style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). You can use the {styler} Addin in RStudio to assist in linting code to conform to some {tidyverse} style guide norms. 

- We use a set of common styles specific to the look and feel of rendered documents, which include: color palettes, ggthemes, and style.css files. These are meant to reduce the amount of time that researchers in this lab spend on relatively inconsequential decisions. The use of these aesthetics also creates a common look and feel of all deliverables from the ROSSyndicate.
