# Flex your GitHub skills... by updating our website!

As a member of our lab, we would like you to update our "People" page to include
you! Here we will lay out the steps for you to fork our lab website repository,
add yourself to our "People" page, and lastly, send a pull request to the
ROSSyndicate to make these changes on the official website. This is a great
chance for you to employ those best practices learned in this document.

## Directions:

• Fork the [lab's website
repository](https://github.com/ROSSyndicate/lab_website).

• Once in your own R environment, create a copy of Matt's bio folder (found in
**content/authors/**); rename to your first name.

• Update `_index.md` to reflect your own bio.

• Replace `avatar.jpg` with your own photo; name it `avatar.jpg`.

• Commit the addition of you bio, then push the branch to your forked
repository.

• In GitHub, submit a pull request with your suggested changes (i.e., including
you!) to the website, following the best practices guide. Assign the review to
Katie Willi, the lab and data manager.

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::wrap_rmd('index.Rmd', width = 80, backup = NULL)
#note, this will not wrap text that are prefaced by any special characters (like bullets!)
```
