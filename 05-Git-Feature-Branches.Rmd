# Git Hub Feature Branches

## When to work in a feature branch

Working in feature branches is similar to working in a forked repository,
except you have two parallel workflows with varying commit history in the same
[forked] repository. It is essential, if you are using branches, that you are
working on a very specific issue or feature (hence the name) that is
independent of others' work on the repo -- or even your other branches!
**IMPORTANT: Try not to leave your branches unmerged for long periods of time
if other folks are working in the same repository to help alleviate merge
conflicts.**

Working in a feature branch is also a way to continue working on a codebase as
other code is in review.

## How to create a feature branch

Make sure the forked main ('origin main') is updated with upstream changes and
all of your current work has been committed to the main branch, then start a
new branch:

> git checkout -b new-branch-name

Branch starts with a copy of the branch you were on. You can now make edits in
this branch and add/commit as usual. If you switch back to the main branch
using `git checkout main`, all of your commit history will revert to that on
the main branch (aka, it will look like all of your work disappeared).

You can either push your branch up to your origin remote (your forked repo)
using:

> git push -u origin new-branch-name

Or you can go back to your main branch and merge your edits from the feature
branch:

> git checkout main git merge new-branch-name

You can also submit a pull request from your feature branch the same way you
would if you were making a pull request from your main branch. Just make sure
you have selected the proper branch from your forked repo.

In general, we only have a single branch ('main') in use at our primary
ROSSyndicate repository.

## Feature branch best practices

-   Keep your fork up to date regularly!! COMMUNICATE.

-   Each team member works on separate files/features (no overlap, feature
    collaboration can take place in the pull requests).

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::wrap_rmd('05-Git-Feature-Branches.Rmd', width = 80, backup = NULL)
#note, this will not wrap text that are prefaced by any special characters (like bullets!)
```
