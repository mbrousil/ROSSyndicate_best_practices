# About

This guide outlines the [ROSSyndicate's](https://rossyndicate.com/) project
management expectations and workflow best practices so that we can successfully
implement Radical Open Science.

## Overarching code/workflow philosophies of the ROSSyndicate

-   We value literate, readable code without sacrificing
    reproducibility. This means deploying understandable code and
    repositories that are accompanied by narrative comments and text. We
    value transparency in our analyses and believe that well documented
    repositories and code facilitate that.

-   All code and software are licensed with the highly permissive MIT
    use license. While we believe that all code and software should be
    public, we acknowledge that other researchers and users may wish to
    keep products derived from our code private. We intentionally avoid
    the GNU-GPL family of licenses that are "viral" by nature, forcing
    all downstream repositories to also be fully open. We do so because
    we acknowledge their are vulnerable populations that may want to
    keep their code private for reasons we may not understand. We hope
    that this encourages use of our code, and ultimately, creates an
    environment of sharing with and empowering each other.

-   GitHub contributions follow the 'fork' methodology that is common in
    open science repositories (as opposed to the 'branch' method).

-   All GitHub contributions are reviewed before being incorporated into
    the lab organization repository, except upon initial repository set
    up. These reviews are completed internally through pull requests. We
    value 'bite-sized' pull requests that usually only contain 500 lines
    of code.

-   No code is formally published unless it has been consistently and
    intentionally reviewed. We make an effort to include external review
    of our repositories prior to formal publishing.

-   We follow [the {tidyverse} style
    guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). We use the {styler} Addin in
    RStudio to assist in linting our code.

-   We strive use a set of common styles specific to the look and feel
    of rendered documents, which include: color palettes, ggthemes, and
    style.css files. These are meant to reduce the amount of time that
    researchers in this lab spend on relatively inconsequential
    decisions. Ideally the use of these aesthetics also creates a common
    look and feel of all deliverables from the ROSSyndicate.

## Contents

This best practices guide serves as an introduction to Git and GitHub, the
lab's style and code philosophies, and the tools we use for project management.

## A living document

The workflow best practices document is a living document and all members of
the ROSSyndicate are welcome to submit edits to it via pull request.

## Origin

Adapted from the Geospatial Centroid's GitHub Workflow Document, Caitlin
Mothes, built out for ROSSyndicate by Katie Willi, B Steele, and Matt Brousil.
