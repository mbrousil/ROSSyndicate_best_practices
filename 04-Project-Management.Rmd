# Project Management and Tracking with GitHub Projects

We use GitHub Projects to track progress and assign tasks to collaborators. A
project is a user interface that integrates with your issues and pull requests
on GitHub to help you plan and manage your work effectively. For Matt R, this
will be where he can go to see quickly where a project is at on its
deliverables, so it is important to keep it up to date. Projects have immense
flexibility and can be tailored to fit the needs of any project.

## Github Project best practices

-   Frame the Project tasks around the statement of work/objectives of the
    project.

-   Take advantage of tags to easily filter and peruse different types of tasks.

-   Break down large tasks into GitHub issues that can [ideally] be completed in
    a single pull request.

See also [GitHub's
document](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/best-practices-for-projects)
of best practices.
