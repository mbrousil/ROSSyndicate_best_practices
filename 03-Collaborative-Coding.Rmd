# Collaborative Coding and Workflow Best Practices

Some sections of this document borrow liberally from the additional resources
listed at the end of the document.

## ROSSyndicate style guide

ROSSyndicate aims to incorporate the [{tidyverse} style
guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for our codebase. Be sure to standardize
file/variable/function style and naming conventions at the beginning of the
project. While this is a somewhat aspirational goal, understanding style guides
will help us all become better programmers. In particular, familiarize yourself
with the sections under 'Analyses'. *We suggest re-reviewing the {tidyverse}
style guide a few times per year just to be reminded of best practices.*

**Some general guidelines:**

-   Use {tidyverse} functions over {base} functions, except in package
    development.

-   Use custom functions over for-loops.

-   If you use the same code chunk three or more times, make it a function and
    use `purrr::map()` (or any `map()` sibling).

-   Use the {magrittr} pipe (%\>%) over native pipe (\|\>).

-   Always include comprehensive documentation for your code.

### Using the 'Styler' Addin

To facilitate adoption of the tidyverse style guide, please install the RStudio
Addin 'Styler'. To do this, click 'Addins' at the top of the RStudio window,
then select 'Set style'. This will prompt you to install the necessary packages
and then define the style transformer. The default is {tidyverse}, so all you
have to do is press 'OK'. As you work on scripts within your repository, select
'Style active file'. This will modify the file to conform to {tidyverse} style.
Be sure to commit these changes. Styler will not tell you what has changed, all
you will see is the following message in your console: While using {styler}
will not correct all style choices, it will fix spacing, assignments, and tabs
automatically.

### Fonts, colors, and .css

[in development!]

In order to reduce any bandwidth necessary and get the most out of your coding
deep work time, we suggest using a few hacks:

-   Use the style_snippets in this repo

### More on literate code...

One aspect of literate code relative to style is that we expect code and code
output to be readable in [nearly] any format. This means whether you are using
the Visual editor in RStudio, you're reading a rendered .html or if you're
viewing an .Rmd on the web or in the Source editor of R Studio. To accomplish
this, we suggest line character length no greater than 80. If you are in an
.Rmd file, just add the last code chunk from the
`style_snippets/markdown_helpers.Rmd`, save your file, and run the chunk. This
will reformat all lines of text so that they are on new lines every 80
characters. If you are in .R or a .md document, use the page-width indicator
(the light vertical blue-grey line on the right of your editor box) in the
Source editor in RStudio to determine when to create a new line in your text
block.

Here's an example of run-on lines:

And what it *should* look like:

## Commit history best practices

-   Always check your forked repository against the upstream repository before
    beginning your coding session and certainly before making any changes to the
    code base using the terminal command `git fetch upstream`.

    -   Think about using your commit history as bullet-point summaries of your
        future pull request. If you need to go back and make some change in your
        commit history, you'll want to have a good idea of where that happened.

    -   Commits should apply to a singular file or multiple
        specifically-selected and related files. In general, this means avoid
        `git add .` unless all the changed files are related - like a .Rmd and
        the rendered .html.

    -   Commits should briefly summarize the changes (e.g., 'work on X', NOT
        'end of day commit').

    -   Commits should describe WHAT and WHY you've made changes/added to your
        code.

-   Always commit your changes to your local repository or branch and push to
    GitHub at the end of your coding session as backup policy (i.e., don't leave
    changes un-tracked when leaving work), ideally this also will result in a
    pull request to your internal creative partner. It's always easier to write
    a pull request when your work is fresh in your mind.

### Adding a co-author to your commit

We strive to always attribute code as we develop our code-base. If you borrow
code from someone else's repository, or if someone has shared a code chunk with
you, add them as a co-author on your commit. To add a co-author, you need to
know the person's GitHub user name or their name and email (if they are not on
GitHub). We suggest making a commit prior to adding any files that originated
from another coder or entering your collaborator's code chunk. This way, it is
very clear what the co-author's contribution was.

So, commit, add the code from your collaborator or another coder, then commit
those changes with them listed as a co-author:

> git commit -m 'Adding function from George
>
> Co-authored-by: George Friend \<gfriend\@users.github.com\>'

Note that you can use the contributor's GitHub user name (in the example above:
'gfriend')

## Pull request best practices

-   The only time you should merge your own pull request is at the initiation of
    your repo, as described in 'Create a New Project'.

-   Pull request should happen frequently, ideally at the end of each work
    session.

-   Pull requests should be 400 lines of code (LOC) or fewer.

-   Use the title of the pull request to help orient your creative partner.

-   Clearly identify what you need in the pull request review.

-   An example of a good pull request, that closes an issue created in your
    GitHub Project (we're assuming issue #7 is 'targets-ify the repo'), and
    makes a specific request of the reviewer:

> Title: apply {targets} to workflow
>
> Primary files for review are the \_targets.R files in the main directory and
> in each subdirectory in the numbered directory step-by-step process. Please
> check for functionality by cloning and running `tar_visnetwork()` for each
> \_targets.R file.
>
> Closes #7

-   If you have a large pull request, i.e. at the beginning of code development
    that is more than 400 LOC, write a useful description alongside your pull
    request that introduces the repo's concepts (\<awesome-workflow\>) and
    highlights specific files (XXX, ZZZ) or commits (5e6b825):

> Purpose: initialize development of YYY repo and start buildout of
> \<awesome-workflow\>
>
> Start of YYY repository. Please review diff for XXX and ZZZ files. Otherwise,
> please do a high-level check of the repository as of the latest commit
> (5e6b825) for general workflow.

## Pull request review best practices

-   Activate notifications for pull requests and comments so you know when a
    pull request has been submitted for your review.

-   If you cannot review the pull request that has been assigned to you before
    the end of the next work day, contact the person who has made the request
    via Teams to let them know when you \*can\* review the PR. The person who
    has made the review can then assign the PR to another person if the review
    is time sensitive.

    -   If possible, cease work on this repo until the PR has been reviewed.
        Every additional `git push origin main` that you make after you submit a
        PR and before it is reviewed and merged will be added into the current
        PR.

    -   If you MUST continue work on the repo while the PR is being reviewed, do
        so in a Feature Branch.

-   If the PR is not clear or does not contain specific asks, DO NOT REVIEW OR
    MERGE, message the pull request creator on Teams and request them to edit
    the detail of the PR to reflect the best practices outlined above.

-   "Before you even look at the code [for review], focus on understanding what
    was changed, why it was changed, and how it was changed." -- [Leone
    Perdigão,
    Medium](https://leoneperdigao.medium.com/pull-request-best-practices-fa20f7daeb3c)

-   Be kind and thoughtful with your comments. We encourage the use of
    ['conventional comments' labels found
    here](https://conventionalcomments.org/#Labels). This allows you to clearly
    engage with the developer on the other end of the PR and offer actionable
    comments.

-   As a reviewer, you should not spend longer than one hour per session in
    active code review and never review more than 500 LOC per hour
    ([SmartBear](https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/best-practices-for-peer-code-review/)).
    Ideally, code review of a PR takes around 30-45 minutes when a project is in
    active development and follows the best practices outlined above.

-   What to look for in code review ([via
    Google](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/)). Note that you do
    not need to check for all of these during a review of code as some are more
    applicable at the beginning of codebase development and others are more
    applicable to review that occurs closer to codebase deployment.

    -   Design: Is the code well-designed and appropriate for your system?

    -   Functionality: Does the code behave as the author likely intended? Is
        the way the code behaves good for its users?

    -   Complexity: Could the code be made simpler? Would another developer be
        able to easily understand and use this code when they come across it in
        the future?

    -   *Tests: Does the code have correct and well-designed automated tests?*
        We do not currently employ tests in our code. We will update information
        on this as we develop ways to include tests in our codebase.

    -   Naming: Did the developer choose clear names for variables, classes,
        methods, etc.? *Do they follow the tidyverse [style
        guides](https://style.tidyverse.org/)?*

    -   Comments: Are the comments clear and useful?

    -   Style: Does the code follow our [*style
        guides*](https://style.tidyverse.org/)?

    -   Documentation: Did the developer also update relevant documentation?
        *This is especially applicable to the README.md files in your repository
        and directories.*

## Types of code review and engaging your internal creative partner

-   Code review is a skill that is learned and developed. Ideally, each member
    of the lab is performing some sort of code review on a weekly basis to grow
    skill in this realm.

-   [Some] types of code review:

    -   Peer-to-peer code review

    -   30-minute session explaining alpha-level code (code in baby development
        that might be in a branch or generally offline from
        the ROSSyndicate organization)

    -   line-by-line code walkthrough meeting

    -   30-minute to 1 hour 'over-the-shoulder' code observation and review

    -   Code review via Pull Request: 

        -   'process review': This type of review is only suggested for early
            feature development OR early repository development. Do the
            decisions and workflow order make sense? Big-picture review only
            and/or suggestions to reduce processing time welcome.  This type of
            review is either preceded or followed by a peer-to-peer code
            walkthrough and explanation.

        -   'general code review': iCP reviews code changes according to usual
            pull request review best practices. This will be the most common
            form of code review via pull request

        -   'ready for release: If a project features end-user reproducibility,
            i.e. Shiny app, published workflow, etc., the iCP should run this
            code in a fresh environment to make sure it runs properly and that
            dependencies are satisfied before pushing for public/partner use.

    -   **Ideally, code developers are engaging in some kind of code review on a
        daily to weekly basis**
